Finding Pluto is a web application that is meant to be a casual, fun way to pass time alone or with others. The purpose will be to navigate a maze while being thrown different obstacles to overcome (such as walls or black holes) and eventually reach Pluto at the end. Users will be able to navigate the maze using the arrow keys and speed will be relevant. Within the game, there are ten base levels categorized into easy, medium, and hard. Users can also create their own levels. Users can choose which level they would like to play after they login or they can play as a guest. When a user reaches Pluto, the next level will be shown.
