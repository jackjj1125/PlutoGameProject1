 ## Description
Our product is going to be a website that hosts the game Finding Pluto. The game is meant to be a casual, fun way to pass time alone or with others. The purpose will be to navigate a maze while being thrown different obstacles to overcome (such as asteroids or black holes) and eventually reach Pluto at the end. Users will be able to navigate the maze using the arrow keys and speed will be relevant. Within the game, we will create ten base levels, and then users will have the ability to create their own levels as well, and invite their friends to play. In addition to inviting friends to play, users will also be able to challenge other users for some friendly competition. <br><br>
When the user first opens the website, they will have a choice as to which level they would like to play. Any levels created by other users will be unlocked to play, however the ten base levels will be unlocked in sequential order (you must pass level one in order to unlock level 2). When a user reaches Pluto, the next level will be unlocked, however points will also be tracked based on the proportion of people who finish after starting, the number of moves it takes to complete the level, and the score upon completion.
